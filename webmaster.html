            <div class="wrapper"><h2> about the webmaster <3 </h2> hihi, i'm not a very interesting person but i wanna write <i>something</i> here so here we go, <br><br>
              i'm <b>fran</b> or kai, and i'm a person!! <i>she/he(/they) (pr much all pronouns)</i> for typology enthusiasts, i'm an INTP 5w4 541 tritype melancholic choleric sp/sx chaotic neutral. for non-nerds, i'm basically an introvert who likes to think and is pretty depressed, but also is kinda artsy and likes to be different. i'm a pretty intense and over the top person. <br><br>
              i'm a sort of mediocre jack of all trades, i do a lot of stuff, though pretty badly or amateurly at best. i like the arts, literature, computer science, history, and more "superficial" things like fashion, make-up and perfume. plus various animanga and other media like video games. i'm a future front-end developer and potentially a lawyer; if you couldn't tell, i'm pretty nerdy. as for hobbies, i like to draw, write poetry, and play games, as well as go into research spirals about mundane or odd things, like chess computers. <br><br>
              i'm a pretty opinionated and talky person. i do speech and debate and i'm pretty alright at it, to be humble. i have a lot of values and opinions, but i don't talk about them too often unless prompted to or have a reason to because i'm not an annoying person who makes my entire personality about my "wokeness" and how i will singlehandedly save the world with my social media activism; or about how politically incorrect and liberal hating i am. i hate annoying politics and useless discourse and i'm very adamant on that more anything else. <br><br>
              i'm a bit of a shut-in, aka, a very big shut-in. i've spent most of my life on the internet and i find comfort in the online sphere more than i do in the real world. because i'm autistic and have the anxiety + depression wombo combo i find it easier to exist in such a space. i'm an enthusiast of computers and the internet because of that sort of awkward situation. i have strong feelings about corporations taking over the internet and destroying any individuality or free reign that netizens once had. as such, i'm a major fanatic about the old-web comeback that's been happening in recent years, and obviously this site is part of that movement. i place great importance on the preservation and archiving of the old web and even current web and find taking back the internet to ordinary netizens incredibly important as well.<br><br>
              i'm a huge nerd if you couldn't tell, but honestly, i've embraced that. i don't know what else to ramble on, so, that's that. i ramble a lot and am very scatter brained, and that'll be evident the more time you spend here. <br><br>

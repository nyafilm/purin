      <p>if you know anything about me, you would know that i am an absolute fanatic of the planets. i listen to it an unhealthy amount. i plan to make an entry on each of the pieces of the suite, but i will start with venus, the bringer of peace! </p>
      <p> now, for some background... the planets is a suite by gustav holst that, well, is meant to capture the essence of each planet in our solar system. he utilizes instrumentation and other principles beautifully throughout the suite to paint vivid images through sound. to put it simply, holst is a master of vibes. you can hear how each planet has its own essence and image. </p> <p> the suite has an immensely powerful introduction with none other than <a href="https://youtu.be/cXOanvv4plU?si=Ml0WxhcO_z6a4AGM"> mars, the bringer of war. </a> if you haven't listened to it yet (somehow), you MUST. not only is it simply one of the greatest pieces of orchestral music ever in my opinion, but listening to it sets you up to appreciate venus fully. </p> <p> now, to venus... the violent, aggressive, and simply bellicose mars is immediately contrasted by the <i> peacefulness</i> of this piece. (get it...?) it opens up with a lonely horn solo that simply sings. shortly, it is answered with a group of flutes that set the dreamy, near romantic tone of this movement. however, tension and strain are heard early on at the end of the flute response. as it continues, the flutes play a sweet, easy line that rocks back and forth. this kind of back and forth motion is a motif in this piece.</p> <p> eventually, you hear violins emerge from silence, finally filling the space, as if to say "i'm here." soon after a swell of sound, a lone violin emerges to play a simply graceful and amorous solo. it is then joined by several others, singing like a choir as it takes melody over. ...and so on so forth. the oboe solo is also beautiful, another graceful and iconic oboe solo alongside the swan lake solo. </p> <p> i could describe the rest of the piece, but i'll spare you that and skip to the end, actually one of my favorite things about venus.</p> <p> the end draws near by tapering away the sound, bringing back just the flutes as melody and the violins + celesta as a fleeting background. the rocking motion reminescent to a lullaby comes back through here which is a nice touch. i love how subtle the celesta is at this part but how much it adds. now i listen to the berliner philharmoniker rendition of the planets, so it may sound different based on who is performing it... but i think this rendition pulls it off excellently. </p> <p> the sound fully tapers with only a whisper of sound, a sustained note as if a release of breath.</p> <br> <p> i freaking love venus, and i wish i could listen to it (and the rest of the planets) the first time again. but each listen is still an amazing experience on its own. i envision lightness, sun and moon, and feathers falling in zero gravity when i think of venus. it is light and agile, but not 'hurried' like mercury can appear. </p> <p> even though venus is the planet of love (after all, venus is the roman counterpart to aphrodite) my interpretation of this piece doesn't quite err on the romantic side as much. i think music as beautiful as this is inherently somewhat romantic, but i see this leaning more peaceful than romantic. </p>
      <p> all in all, i think venus is one of the greatest orchestral pieces i've had the pleasure of listening to. i give venus, the bringer of peace, a solid 8.75/10.</p>

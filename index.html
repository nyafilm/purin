(of course, you should be able to read and view stuff just fine on mobile, it just may be a bit ugly.) <p> oh yeah, about that, i am not very experienced or even "good" at coding. i am constantly learning about how to make things more efficent, look better, etc. of course, this site is, and will always be, a culmination of that. <p> </article></body>

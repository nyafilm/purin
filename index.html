          <div class="entry">
            <p>
      <p> <em>this site is currently going through yet another major revamp!!</em> <br> hi there, i'm fran and i'm the webmaster/mistress for this little corner of the infinitely-sided 4D shape that is the internet. this site has seen many days and has been picked up and then left to gather dust a fair amount of times. but, it can at least know that it will always be returned to at some point or another. this site was created in the midst of the horrors that is known as middle school. not only was i unbearably annoying, but my coding skills weren't too good. they still aren't, but still. as time marched on, i've left the site on its own, came back to revamp it, maintained it for a bit, got busy, and left several times. life is busy T.T <br><br> if i remember correctly, this site is on its 5th revamp. as always, there is never a guarantee each revamp will be the last, and it'll stay that way :P <br> <br> right now, the site is barebones and wiped, completely different from its previous edition. this is because i felt that the layout then didn't truly reflect me and also started to become bloated. i cared more about maintaining the cutesy aesthetics of it than my actual enjoyment of making it. so, after a long hiatus with few updates on the blog, i sat down and started anew. (<i>there are some pages i left untouched because i liked them and want to perserve that layout, or i'm wanting to tackle it later :,p</i>) </i>this time around, i plan to be more technical and thoughtful about the content and nature of this site, as well as a slightlydifferent approach to the aesthetics of it. after all, i still do love web design :p <br> <br> computers, technology, and the internet have always been a part of me. i want to pursue computers and stuff as an adult, it's that important to me. this site, though personal, will always be a reflective culmination of my appreciation of the internet and technology. as convoluted and capitalist the world of technology is, i'm a part of the community of people who enjoy it for how it was meant to be appreciated. <br><br> as i am a student, i'll rarely be able to update this place often. however,. like i mentioned before, i'll always come back ^_^ i hope you enjoy what there is here on my shoddy digital journal.</p>

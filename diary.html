			<div style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" class="entry"> <b> 5.27.22 </b> well, school has ended. i have so many feelings and thoughts about this school year, but ultimately it was certainly unique. it was remarkable, memorable, in a good way, unlike past school years. i miss him, the boy i like. he's been on my mind nonstop, and i'm kind of driving myself even more insane than before thinking about him. the thing is, we hand't talked or interacted much. if we did, it turned sour immediately. yet, i caught him looking and staring at me so often... it wasn't a coincidence. even one of his friends said he liked me and was staring at me. i have his number and whatnot, yet, i can't muster the courage to text him. it's a debilitating yearning. i miss him, but even that phrase means so little, it doesn't entirely, if at all, capture what i feel. there's a quote from delta of venus that reminds me much of him, “he had not touched me. he did not need to. his presence had affected me in such a way that i felt as if he had caressed me for a long time.” i hope this school year i can talk to him and get to know him. as much as i hate to admit it, i am unfathomably in love. hopelessly, fatally, obsessed. limerence, is what you could call it. but, enough of my boy troubles. for now, i'll call him T. moving on, summer school begins next week, which i am oddly excited about. i'm taking p.e. and health over the summer to complete my credits for it this 2022=2023 year. i guess i'm just excited because it gives me something to do. a weird thing about me is that i tend to break down if i don't have anything to distract me over a period of time. despite me disliking school often, i would prefer going than not at all. over spring break, for example, my mental health plummetts. i need to constantly be busy; if i stop moving, if i stop <i> doing</i>, i die. that's all i can think to say right now. that's all.</div>
	
		<div style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" class="entry"> <b> 5.2.22 </b> hello long time no update. im doing pretty okay. theres this boy i like, hes really cute but i admit hes a fucking asshole. idk why i like him, hes such an odd guy. oh well, i cant help these feelings, and its best not to suppress or hide these feelings. being honest to myself is the best way to go about all things, ive found. school ends at the end of this month, and its just a lot to process. this year has been a lot. this summer will be the summer before high school, and i hope my friends and i have a great one to top off our final summer before high school kills us all inevitably. (thats a joke, kind of) things happen, i guess. life is going, and sometimes, thats more than enough. </div>
	
	<div style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" class="entry"> <b> 3.29.22 </b> this friday my friend and i are gonna see if i can be a tubist next marching season :P for reference im a flutist right now. im wanting to be a flutist in concert band next year but just for marching season i wanna play the marching tuba. today was fun for the most part, but i'm pretty tired. im looking forward to band mostly nowadays, especially our spring concert and our field trip next month ^^ i think thats all for now. </div>
	
<div style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" class="entry"> <b> 3.22.22 </b> i'd hope that my depression would ease up now that school is back, but it didn't much, if at all. it's a bit disappointing, really. i've been working a bit on learning some more web coding stuff, so i'll do some stuff with it at some point probably. i'm waiting for something to look forward to, so i don't feel so mind-numbingly empty all the damn time. as long as i can get through the day, i'll be fine. </div>
  
 <div style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" class="entry"> <b> 3.16.22 </b> today wasnt as good as id hope itd be. for me, breaks for school always end up in turmoil. i cut myself a little too deep, got too knife happy. im really disappointed in myself, but i dont really have much to do about it other than just rest and try not to do it again. 4 days until school resumes, and i can distract myself again. </div>

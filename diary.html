<div style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" class="entry"> <b> 3.22.22 </b> i'd hope that my depression would ease up now that school is back, but it didn't much, if at all. it's a bit disappointing, really. i've been working a bit on learning some more web coding stuff, so i'll do some stuff with it at some point probably. i'm waiting for something to look forward to, so i don't feel so mind-numbingly empty all the damn time. as long as i can get through the day, i'll be fine. </div>
  
 <div style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" class="entry"> <b> 3.16.22 </b> today wasnt as good as id hope itd be. for me, breaks for school always end up in turmoil. i cut myself a little too deep, got too knife happy. im really disappointed in myself, but i dont really have much to do about it other than just rest and try not to do it again. 4 days until school resumes, and i can distract myself again. </div>

he hadn't touched me<br>
not ever <br>
and yet he didn't need to<br>
his presence<br>
the fact that he was there<br>
was more than enough<br>
he isn't here anymore<br>
not anymore<br>
it hasn't been long<br>
yet <br>
his absence <br>
such a profound loss<br>
as if he had held me for so long<br>
pulling away, leaving, leaving<br>
i think of him more than myself <br>
i think of him more than anything<br>
he is everything, more than, even<br>
and yet<br>
i have felt so little of him<br>
known so little <br>
like a drizzling rain<br>
or a evangelical whisper<br>
he is so dear to me despite his hideous nothing <br>
i feel empty<br>
not a drop of water inside me to try to see<br>
i am simply an empty glass  <br>
i will never have his love to keep<br>
nothing to fill that him-shaped hole<br>
in my heart<br>
i've never felt this way before<br>
never have i felt so alone<br> 
missing a touch i have never felt <br>
i miss him, i want to say <br>
but what is there to miss <br>
you can't miss nothing <br>
can you?<br>

i fell in love with him the way you fall asleep<br>
a little bit, then all at once<br>
i used to believe that love was impossible <br>
so, so impossible, so difficult <br>
yet, it still goes on and went on and on<br>
despite my beliefs.<br>
one sided love is perhaps the only love<br>
that could ever come my way<br>
a delusional, manic kind<br>
with an air of erotic insanity<br>
with open arms i claw my way through it <br>
and i come out thinking i am free<br>
until i fall back through again<br>
back to where it always begins<br>
a passing glance and winding red<br>
until i am nothing but yearning<br>

want was tearing his flesh off<br>
and eating him alive<br>
crawling inside of his ribcage<br>
adoring every inch inside and out<br>
love him, i do, i carnally desire him<br>
cupping his face and kissing him whole<br>
feeling glass break against glass<br>
bruising hips and thighs <br>
his vocal cords snap in broken chords<br>
glorious, i think, seeing you smile<br>
your gaze brushing my jawline <br>
my insanity is almost erotic <br>
a breath of mania in the air <br>
as i imagine your teeth against mine<br>
your hands ripping into my back <br>
my own clawing your collarbone<br>
this is momentary forgiveness;<br>
longing, loneliness, yearning, <br>
all of it erased in your last glance <br>

i've always wondered,<br>
why do bad things keep happening to me?<br>
what did i do to deserve this? why, do i deserve this?<br>
it's like when i feel that i'm at my lowest,<br>
suddenly the world turns against me, and<br>
i am alone. i am hopeless, helpless, tasteless for acting <br>
and believing the notion that these bad things are a punishment <br>
from some angry universal force. <br>
why do these things keep happening to me?<br>

my stomach churns painfully in regret<br>
my bitterness has turned me cruel,<br>
cruel, like hateful cold creeping up a back<br>
in the midst of winter, killing you slowly<br>
i am empty, cruel and empty of all feeling<br>
if i cannot be loved then i will be feared<br>
a metallic taste in my mouth haunts me<br>

<br>
cherry red perfume stains my lungs <br>
a deep, sultry, sweet gourmand<br>
why i feel this way i do not know<br>
you leave the taste of regret in my mouth<br>
now all i know is regret and regret more<br>
cherry sweet and bitter and cold <br>
red, a deep glowing red, lust and anger<br>
swirling deep in the pits of my stomach<br>
drizzled with a tasteless chypre.  <br>

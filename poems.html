all i know in life,<br>
is that holidays come and go<br>
and that nothing ever lasts.<br>
<br><br>
to all the girls who i have hugged,<br>
and the boys i have loved, in very<br>
heavy quotes, and all the lies i have<br>
tried to manifest within myself,<br>
<br><br>
gritty dust in the dry heat, as i watch<br>
the setting horizon.<br>
<br><br>
a lesson i have learned time and time again,<br>
is that what matters most in the moment,<br>
never matters in the end.<br>
<br><br>
all these tears are meaningless,<br>
all the cat scratches and all the words that fall out,<br>
they fall into the void, the endlessly vast void,<br>
and turn into nothing.<br>
<br><br>
i walk forward with nothing in mind,<br>
there is nothing to look forward to,<br>
nothing to enjoy, nothing to want.<br>
<br><br>
how could i want something,<br>
when i know it won’t last?<br>
<br><br>
what is the point of happiness,<br>
when it won’t last?<br>
<br><br>
i don’t deserve happiness in the first place,<br>
when i can’t be in control of it.<br>
<br><br>
all the joy in the world,<br>
bright and warm in my hands,<br>
the ambient warmth of golden hour,<br>
the steady rhythm of an anonymous heartbeat,<br>
in my hands.<br>
<br><br>
then,<br><br>

like how rain falls,<br><br>
<br><br>
slowly,
<br><br>
drip by drip,
<br><br>
it begins to falter.
<br><br>
i haven’t learned my lesson this time,<br>
and i’m unsure if i ever will.<br>
<br><br>
i am in the dark again, my breath quivering,<br>
as i realize what has happened once again.<br>
<br><br>
long meaningless paragraphs cross my mind,<br>
as i try to make sense of why i’m like this,<br>
why i am so incapable of being happy?<br>
<br><br>
why can’t i just stay happy?
<br><br>
why is it that difficult?
<br><br>
i’ll never know why.
<br><br>
all i can do,
<br><br>
is keep repeating the same mistakes,
<br><br>
over and over again,
<br><br>
and hope that i learn at some point,
<br><br>
that nothing ever lasts.

to be desired is perhaps the closest i can get to feeling like i am real<br>
last night i dreamed of strawberry shortcake in italy, and for the first time, you weren’t there<br>
for a long time i wandered aimlessly believing i couldn’t ever live without feeling this way<br>
yet here i am,<br>
in a white button up sitting in the sidewalk,<br>
you out of my mind,<br>
how does it feel?<br>
<br><br>
it changes a lot, how i feel,<br>
papers stacked upon papers, curtains left down, gathering dust in the corner of the room,<br>
an air of mania as another hour fades late into the night, another foolish ambition i will forget soon,<br>
the desire to not exist, but not necessarily to die,<br>
but never a feeling of peace, or even contentment<br>
<br>
late in the night, humid air stuffing my lungs, i lean out my window and call a name into the night,<br>
a name that once had meaning, value, but now is just a name.<br>
<br><br>
impulsively my hands wrap around safety scissors and the familiar glass neck, a rusting box cutter, fingers hovering above the send button as my mind wanders off again,<br>
<br><br>
endlessly walking forward despite my desire to simply stop; there is and never was any meaning or value to this, yet, i tread on. i desire meaning, i desire purpose, but it’s always short lived.<br>
<br><br>
flickering streetlights as i watch for the night bus, and for a split second, i thought of you again<br>
and for a split second, you were there<br>
<br><br>
across the isle you sit, looking away from me,<br>
and i do the same, out of a common late night courtesy. yet, we both know what we’re thinking. yet, we know it’s for the best.<br>
<br><br>
the next time i see you, you’re sitting in the dry grass in summer heat, panting. i look away again, knowing that this was for the best. we act like we don’t exist to one another, and that’s for the best.<br>
<br><br>
summer melts away into a cruel autumn; and those nights are where i wonder of you the most. in the crowds and in the music numbing our brains, the thought of you emerges in mine.<br>
<br><br>
we know that this is for the best, we know that this is how it ends. there was no grand symphonic crescendos or candlelit goodbyes, no twilight shadows to obscure your face as you find mine.<br>
<br><br>
it ends like this,<br>
<br><br>
we’re walking in the same direction down a street with people we don’t know,<br>
we’re walking, speeding up to both avoid and catch the other, and we don’t say a word.<br>
we’re not looking at each other, yet in the corner of our eyes we know that side profile.<br>
we’re walking, and despite what we want to do, we know why things are the way they are.<br>
<br><br>
it ends with a silence, not deafening or numbing, but an unremarkable silence; as much as we wanted things to go differently, we know why it went how it did. this is how it ends, and we don’t try to change it.

he hadn't touched me<br>
not ever <br>
and yet he didn't need to<br>
his presence<br>
the fact that he was there<br>
was more than enough<br>
he isn't here anymore<br>
not anymore<br>
it hasn't been long<br>
yet <br>
his absence <br>
such a profound loss<br>
as if he had held me for so long<br>
pulling away, leaving, leaving<br>
i think of him more than myself <br>
i think of him more than anything<br>
he is everything, more than, even<br>
and yet<br>
i have felt so little of him<br>
known so little <br>
like a drizzling rain<br>
or a evangelical whisper<br>
he is so dear to me despite his hideous nothing <br>
i feel empty<br>
not a drop of water inside me to try to see<br>
i am simply an empty glass  <br>
i will never have his love to keep<br>
nothing to fill that him-shaped hole<br>
in my heart<br>
i've never felt this way before<br>
never have i felt so alone<br> 
missing a touch i have never felt <br>
i miss him, i want to say <br>
but what is there to miss <br>
you can't miss nothing <br>
can you?<br>

i fell in love with him the way you fall asleep<br>
a little bit, then all at once<br>
i used to believe that love was impossible <br>
so, so impossible, so difficult <br>
yet, it still goes on and went on and on<br>
despite my beliefs.<br>
one sided love is perhaps the only love<br>
that could ever come my way<br>
a delusional, manic kind<br>
with an air of erotic insanity<br>
with open arms i claw my way through it <br>
and i come out thinking i am free<br>
until i fall back through again<br>
back to where it always begins<br>
a passing glance and winding red<br>
until i am nothing but yearning<br>

want was tearing his flesh off<br>
and eating him alive<br>
crawling inside of his ribcage<br>
adoring every inch inside and out<br>
love him, i do, i carnally desire him<br>
cupping his face and kissing him whole<br>
feeling glass break against glass<br>
bruising hips and thighs <br>
his vocal cords snap in broken chords<br>
glorious, i think, seeing you smile<br>
your gaze brushing my jawline <br>
my insanity is almost erotic <br>
a breath of mania in the air <br>
as i imagine your teeth against mine<br>
your hands ripping into my back <br>
my own clawing your collarbone<br>
this is momentary forgiveness;<br>
longing, loneliness, yearning, <br>
all of it erased in your last glance <br>

i've always wondered,<br>
why do bad things keep happening to me?<br>
what did i do to deserve this? why, do i deserve this?<br>
it's like when i feel that i'm at my lowest,<br>
suddenly the world turns against me, and<br>
i am alone. i am hopeless, helpless, tasteless for acting <br>
and believing the notion that these bad things are a punishment <br>
from some angry universal force. <br>
why do these things keep happening to me?<br>

my stomach churns painfully in regret<br>
my bitterness has turned me cruel,<br>
cruel, like hateful cold creeping up a back<br>
in the midst of winter, killing you slowly<br>
i am empty, cruel and empty of all feeling<br>
if i cannot be loved then i will be feared<br>
a metallic taste in my mouth haunts me<br>

<br>
cherry red perfume stains my lungs <br>
a deep, sultry, sweet gourmand<br>
why i feel this way i do not know<br>
you leave the taste of regret in my mouth<br>
now all i know is regret and regret more<br>
cherry sweet and bitter and cold <br>
red, a deep glowing red, lust and anger<br>
swirling deep in the pits of my stomach<br>
drizzled with a tasteless chypre.  <br>

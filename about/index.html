    <div class="abt"> <p> hi there, i'm <em> kai </em> <i>(or fran, online)</i> and i'm the webmaster/mistress/thing of this site. i had a whole spiel about this actual site on the homepage, so i'm not gonna go too much into that again. </p> <p> i'm a mediocre and eccentric teenager who enjoys the finer things in life: perfume, web design, and things that look and feel nice. as seemingly shallow as i seem, i do in fact think sometimes.</p> <p> of course, i love computers and technology and the internet and blahabkaewvoueuygdfguy but i also apparently like other things. if i wasn't annoying enough, i'm a band fanatic. i play the flute and i also want to be a tubist desperately. i take interest in things like makeup, fashion, writing, cooking, and more. as mentioned before, i'm very Normal about perfume as well. i was super into fandom and such for most of my developmental years and kinda am but also not. i'm a very ambigiously interested enjoyer of things. my pasttimes include listening to music, rotting in bed, drawing, reading and editing wikipedia articles, and talking to friends. i also love long, run on sentences that border on incomprehensible. i type the way i speak, basically. </p> <p> i hate talking about my pathology, but as you can tell, i'm a pretty weird thing. i have a few things wrong with my mortal form. i used to be super into typology and that stuff; last i checked, i'm an INTP 5w4 melchol. is it inaccurate? possibly. </p> <p> i'm not good at talking about myself, but also it's not like it matters. after all, this is my site -.o in the end, i'm talking at the void that is the endless expanse of the internet. i hope you have a good time here :3 </p></div>

            Chaotic Neutral - A chaotic neutral character follows their whims. They are an individualist first and last. They value their own liberty but don't strive to protect others' freedom. They avoid authority, resent restrictions, and challenge traditions. A chaotic neutral character does not intentionally disrupt organizations as part of a campaign of anarchy. To do so, they would have to be motivated either by good (and a desire to liberate others) or evil (and a desire to make those different from themself suffer). A chaotic neutral character may be unpredictable, but their behavior is not totally random. They are not as likely to jump off a bridge as to cross it. Chaotic neutral is the best alignment you can be because it represents true freedom from both society's restrictions and a do-gooder's zeal. However, chaotic neutral can be a dangerous alignment when it seeks to eliminate all authority, harmony, and order in society. <br>

            Half-Elf - Half-elves have the curiosity and ambition for their human parent and the refined senses and love of nature of their elven parent, although they are outsiders among both cultures. To humans, half-elves are paler, fairer and smoother-skinned than their human parents, but their actual skin tones and other details vary just as human features do. Half-elves tend to have green, elven eyes. They live to about 180.

            Wizard - Wizards are arcane spellcasters who depend on intensive study to create their magic. To wizards, magic is not a talent but a difficult, rewarding art. When they are prepared for battle, wizards can use their spells to devastating effect. When caught by surprise, they are vulnerable. The wizard's strength is her spells, everything else is secondary. She learns new spells as she experiments and grows in experience, and she can also learn them from other wizards. In addition, over time a wizard learns to manipulate her spells so they go farther, work better, or are improved in some other way. A wizard can call a familiar- a small, magical, animal companion that serves her. With a high Intelligence, wizards are capable of casting very high levels of spells.</span>

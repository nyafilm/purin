      <p>for as long as i have been alive, i have had an absurd obsession with death, dying, and the inevitablity of it. when i was only 12, i thought i would be dead by 18. (though, that's probably more of a mental illness thing than anything else. regardless,)  i have spent a lot of time ruminating on death and how i feel about it. and it's not like i've had one coherent idea about it my whole life either; far from that, actually. i have loathed it, i have loved it, i have avoided the thought of it, and more. death is all consuming.</p> 
      <p> like all the greats, i am mentally ill. with that, came the eternal question, will this suffering ever amount to something? will it be worth it in the end? obviously, i try to work to make sure it will. perhaps that's a naive thing to do, but i do it regardless. i try to take the reins on my life as much as i can. what haunts me (and sometimes comforts me) is the idea it wouldn't mean anything anyway. destiny and fate comfort meâ€”but simultaneously, what if i am destined for a life of misery? what if this is all i will ever amount to? it's horrifying. it's comforting, then, to believe that destiny has something greater than i could ever imagine in store for me. i won't know. how do you distinguish pure will to change the trajectory of your life vs. what the universe has planned the whole time? you can't. you don't. perhaps it is in tandem.</p>
      <p> what if, then, my purpose is to simply die? i have obsessed over death enough to consider that more than once. although, that was in the midst of some pretty bad depressive episodes. we live only to die, perhaps? i disagree with that notion. maybe, instead, death is relief. that, i agree with. that means i have to establish something else: that we are being relieved of being alive. earnestly, i cannot say i enjoy being alive. i cannot say with certainty that i am even <i> okay</i> with being alive. it's just something i happen to be. i can say that, at times, i have hated being alive. it is a dreary, dreary experience. not always do i feel that way, but that feeling is more existent than its contrary. which is why death serves to relieve me from my mandatory service: existence. </p>
      <p>but why is that so? as in, why is being alive so miserable that oblivion is my preferred state? i could jump into a whole separate sub-essay on why my life sucks and why i want to die, but that's already why i'm writing this and that's just a boring subject to yap about. my idea is certainly not original, and certainly not unpopular. my belief, of course, is that simply being alive is suffering. ("what a genius, what an unheard-of idea!") there are several reasons why someone would hate being alive, and that is all deeply individual. however, i believe in the notion that the whole gist of being alive is to suffer. to be is to suffer and to suffer is to be, or something stupid like that. the human condition is suffering. nothing but. i already hear you thinking, "well, yeah, you stupidfatuglyidiot, of course suffering is part of the human condition." i think that those two things are one and the same. suffering is being human, being human is suffering, nothing more and nothing less. </p> 
      <p> that doesn't mean that there aren't points where i feel happy, or there aren't points where i enjoy things. duh! all the things i do to feel happy or even fulfilled are just distractions from universal, existential dread. consider that existential crises and whatnot aren't just inner conflicts or phases of thought, but rather breaks in the mundanity of life and distraction from the only reason we exist. of course we distract ourselves and claw to find any meaning or purpose in our lives. the alternative is unbearable. </p>
      <p> we exist only to suffer, and that suffering is what defines our humanity. why then, do i live? because i have no other choice. perhaps this is mental illness speaking, but i personally feel as if i deserve to live. as in, i deserve to suffer. it comes together eventually! i believe that, in the end, when i relinquish my existence to the void, when oblivion consumes me and i become one with it... my suffering will have been worth it. despite it all, i have the naivety to think that something good can come from the horrors of the human condition. yes, even if that good is the relief of my final exit. </p>
